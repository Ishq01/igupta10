Introduction to MongoDB
- Database: structured way to store and access data
- MongoDB is a NoSQL document database: 
    - Doesn’t use related tables of data (no rows or columns)
    - Data is stored in documents, and documents are stored in collections
        -Organize data as a set of field-value pairs (key-value pairs)
    - Collection: organized store, usually with common fields between documents

MongoDB Atlas
- Atlas: fully managed database with MongoDB at it's core
- Can deploy clusters: 
    - Clusters: a group of servers configured in replica sets that store your data
    - Replica set: a few connected machines that store the same data to ensure data remains intact (backup)
    - Instance: a single machine locally or in the cloud, running a certain software (MongoDB database in this case)

- JSON: the document format (key: value, key: value})
	- readable, friendly, familiar
	- text-based, space-consuming, limited
- BSON: binary JSON, optimized
- Anything in JSON can be viewed in Mongo! Mongo stores data as BSON, but users view it in JSON
